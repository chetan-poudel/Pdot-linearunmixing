# Pdot-linearunmixing
This MATLAB script is designed to accompany our manuscript submission to Science Advances by Guo et al in 2024. This simple script takes raw "mixed" images and a calibration matrix as input and applies simple linear unmixing to output "unmixed" images for a number of image channels.
